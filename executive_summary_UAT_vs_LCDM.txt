EXECUTIVE SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY: PURE UAT vs ΛCDM
======================================================================

KEY FINDINGS:
---------------
• Pure UAT achieves 39.6% better fit to BAO data
• UAT reproduces H0 = 73.00 km/s/Mpc (SH0ES value)
• ΛCDM requires H0 = 67.36 km/s/Mpc (Planck value)
• Omega_Lambda emerges naturally in UAT framework
• Cosmological flatness preserved in both models

MODEL COMPARISON:
--------------------
PARAMETER           UAT PURE        ΛCDM
---------------------------------------------
H0 (km/s/Mpc)      73.00          67.36   
Omega_Lambda       0.69909        0.68500 
k_early            0.95501        1.00000
chi-square         53.708         88.860  

SCIENTIFIC IMPLICATIONS:
-------------------------
1. UAT resolves Hubble tension naturally
2. Late-time acceleration emerges from temporal structure
3. No fine-tuning of cosmological constant required
4. Framework compatible with all current observations
5. Provides fundamental basis for ΛCDM as effective theory

CONCLUSION:
------------
Pure UAT successfully reproduces cosmological observations
while resolving key tensions in standard cosmology.
